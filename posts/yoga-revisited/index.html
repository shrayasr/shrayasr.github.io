			<p>When I started with my training plan, yoga wasn&rsquo;t exactly my strong point. I
couldn&rsquo;t flow, I couldn&rsquo;t even sustain a pose, I never felt like I was doing
anything at all. I never felt like I &ldquo;worked out&rdquo;. My coach asked to believe in
the practice and to give it my best. And, I continued to try. It&rsquo;s been about a
year now that I started this journey and things have changed so much. Just this
week, I was able to keep up with the instructor on 2 full sessions. Flowing
with them, and my breath. I was able to hold my poses. I was able to breathe
deep. I was able to do everything that I thought was <em>hard</em>. I&rsquo;m able to truly
feel the asana inside of me.</p>
<p>Today, I went from a fold to a tree pose and I just had this burst of gratitude
in me. As if, it finally clicked. I&rsquo;ve come a long way in this journey of the
mind and the body. And today I feel proud of it. The path ahead doesn&rsquo;t scare
me anymore, I know that if I put my effort into it and show up to my mat, my
body will listen. It will move, it will flow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so tremendously excited for what lies ahead. It&rsquo;s been such a humbling
journey within. And I owe it all to discipline, effort, trust of my coach and
the space around me that allowed me to fail.</p>
