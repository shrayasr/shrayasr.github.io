      <description>ðŸ’¡ This post was written long ago and might not necessarily reflect my thoughts at this time Some people see him in deities. Some people see him as a spiritual being. Some people believe he was a human living among us.
Me, I dont believe in religion. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. I believe in a god. I believe in a power but I&amp;rsquo;m not a part of those groups that separate this being into different sects demarked by religion.</description>

      <description>ðŸ’¡ This post was written long ago and might not necessarily reflect my thoughts at this time The title indicates something very spiritual, but trust me its not. I&amp;rsquo;m not a very spiritual guy and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will ever be.
