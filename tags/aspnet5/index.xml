      <description>Background After the recent dance with multiple Mono versions, the next step was to actually host the application.
Even though the app is largely still unfinished, I wanted to give it a shot on the staging instance to get a feel for things.
The general way to host apps on a Linux box is to have a NGINX reverse proxy in front, listening to different names on port 80 and to proxy the requests to internally running servers.</description>

      <description>Background Logic Soft&amp;lsquo;s primary application is a Windows based application written in C# using Windows.Forms. So when Microsoft announced ASP .NET 5 RC1, needless to say, we were quite excited.
We picked it up and started our experimentation - writing smaller applications and porting some of our side projects to the CoreCLR platform. As long as we didn&amp;rsquo;t go to the place that needed WIN32 APIs, it worked seamlessly.
With a small sum of experience, we took up the task of writing one of our internal dashboards with it.</description>
