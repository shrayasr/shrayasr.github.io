      <description>Its been a really long time since I wrote something.. I guess I lacked that push, I guess I was focussing on other things. But today, I got that push.
7:25PM, was just chilling in my room taking some classes on Natural Language Processing when I got a call &amp;ldquo;Macha, I&amp;rsquo;m in Bangalore, come lets shoot&amp;rdquo;
8:05PM, Brigade Road, I met Waseem. Its been a while since we met and shot together.</description>
