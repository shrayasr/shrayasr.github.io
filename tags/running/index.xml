      <description>For a very long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve looked for a (ultra) running parallel to this scene:
Which is a scene and something I personally relate to a lot in my life. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen this clip, do so before you come back to read the rest of this
And today, as I was running at 8:00AM in Chennai&amp;rsquo;s sun, I realized. This was in a way, my shadow.
As much as running is regarded as a sport (and an event) where you are running with so many people, fundamentally seasoned runners know that when the buzzer goes off, we are alone.</description>

      <title>The Secret of Ultra Running</title>

      <description>The more I get involved with ultra running and more so running in general, the more I get the sense that there is no secret to it. It feels as if asking an ace ultra runner what their secret is, would never get us any real meaningful answer.
Start by making a plan. Then show up everyday, execute the plan and move on with your day. Do it today, do it tomorrow, do it the day after.</description>

      <description>For context, I&amp;rsquo;ve been running since a good 4 years now.
4 years of putting 1 foot ahead of another. 4 years of braving through pain. 4 years of surviving injuries. 4 years of meeting wonderful people. 4 years of time to reflect. After doing 4 years of running, I thought I had it under my belt. I thought that I had &amp;ldquo;figured out&amp;rdquo; running. After having run so many kilometers with so many people across so many cities and clocking so many hours, I was under the impression that I was &amp;ldquo;comfortable&amp;rdquo; with the sport of running.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t listen to your body</title>

      <description>In the quest to become better than the runner you were yesterday, I would argue that it is required of you to not listen to your body.
Allow me to elaborate. The body is a miraculous machine. The very fact that people are able to run such absurd distances is a feat of this very machine. But it is important to, in training, not listen to this very same machine.</description>

      <description>Background Circa 2013 - 2014, I was quite the couch potato. Sure I had played a bit of Basket ball in school and got my everyday quota of India&amp;rsquo;s favourite game - gully cricket, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ever an active person.
That is, until The Himalayas happened.
Soon after my first trek, Raghu and I decided one evening that we&amp;rsquo;d just take a bus to some part of town. Our rendezvous point was about 1 Kilometer from where I stayed at that point.</description>
