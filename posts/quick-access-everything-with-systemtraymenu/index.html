<p>Being head of engineering at a firm means having to juggle a lot of context. And in this quest, I am always looking for ways to optimize my workflow. I can (greatly) simplify all of the work I do into these categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Talking to folks &ndash; Zoom
<ul>
<li>Usually via pre defined links - My personal link / Standup link / My founder&rsquo;s personal link</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My own work &ndash; Visual Studio
<ul>
<li>Open a project in Visual Studio from my local directory of projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Collaboration &ndash; GitHub
<ul>
<li>Open a project in GitHub to log an issue / review a pull request</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A tool that I already use quite extensively is <a href="https://keypirinha.com/">Key Pirinha</a> which is the Alfred/Spotlight/Launchy equivalent for windows and is blazing fast. I could do all of the above tasks in it in some fashion but it doesn&rsquo;t do much justice and needs a lot of setup.</p>
<p>I was looking for a way to organize all of this together and have one place to access them from - without me having to code anything for it. In other words, I was looking for a better start menu - one that I could entirely control myself.</p>
<h1 id="my-solution">My Solution</h1>
<p>In my search for a solution, GitHub one day suggested a project on the home page - <a href="https://github.com/Hofknecht/SystemTrayMenu">SystemTrayMenu</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusHofknecht">Markus Hofknecht</a>. I was intrigued just looking at the name and I checked it out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SystemTrayMenu is a free, open-source start menu alternative for Microsoft Windows. It offers a clear, personalized menu in the system tray. Files, links and folders are organized in several levels as drop-down menus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52528841/90009201-ee0c9680-dc9d-11ea-9b8a-b34108152f9b.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I was immediately sold! This seemed like the right tool for me to use to build out my requirement on.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>To get a feel for things, I begun by wanting to solve the hardest of my problems - #2 - Opening a project in VS from my local directory. I just gave my <code>~/work/code</code> directory to STM and was able to on demand open up any folder and its associated project file in my IDE - This improved my productivity greatly! The search is pretty great too, its not fuzzy but then it solves the problem well enough.</p>
<p>With this confidence, I wanted to take it forward and apply it to the other parts of my workflow. The biggest problem in wanting to solve all 3 problems is that I <strong>did not</strong> want to rearrange any part of my folder structure to support usage via STM.</p>
<p>STM has a fantastic feature of following links. This means that I can make a link called <code>projects</code> to my <code>~/work/code</code> folder in a <code>~/STM</code> folder and start STM pointing to <code>~/STM</code> and it will follow <code>projects -&gt; ~/work/code</code> and allow me to browse it. This makes it super easy for anyone to set up their &ldquo;quick access&rdquo; folders by just creating shortcuts.</p>
<p>So with that in place, my STM folder started to take shape</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>STM/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>└── projects -&gt; ~/work/code
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="zoom-links">Zoom links</h2>
<p>Since zoom links are fundamentally just URLs, I can just create shortcuts to them in another directory. To create a URL shortcut on windows, we have to create a file and do 2 things</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use the extension <code>.url</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the following content in the file</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>[InternetShortcut]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>URL=http://shrayas.com
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<p>So with this, I then created the required zoom URL links and put them into my STM folder under the subdirectory <code>zoom</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>STM/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>├── projects -&gt; ~/work/code
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>└── zoom/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    ├── standup.url
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    ├── my.url
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    └── name1.url
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="github">GitHub</h2>
<p>This was the part that took me some time. On a daily basis, I have to review code in / file issues on / share links to a quite a sum of projects. And for that it is important that I can open the repo on GitHub quickly.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of GitHub&rsquo;s search. I think its slow and many a time, doesn&rsquo;t throw up the result that I am expecting. Because of this, a while ago .. I wrote a small program for myself to help me with this and called it GitHub Browse</p>
<p><img src="/img/STM/ghbrowse1.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/img/STM/ghbrowse2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It was a quick way for me to open any project that I was interested in. The data was stored as a JSON file that I could refresh using my Personal Access Token from GitHub. It worked fine.</p>
<p>Since I was moving my workflow to STM, I thought it be wise to consolidate it over there instead of maintaining a separate program for this. So I modified the program to instead spit out <code>.url</code> files linking to all the repositories into a <code>gh</code> folder under the <code>STM</code> folder.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>STM/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>├── projects -&gt; ~/work/code
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>├── zoom/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>│   ├── standup.url
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>│   ├── my.url
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>│   └── name1.url
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>└── gh/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    ├── project1.url
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    ├── project2.url
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    └── project3.url
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>An unfortunate downside of this was that I lost the ability to directly go to issues or PRs or to just copy the link.. but those are usually just a click away so I was OK with making that compromise. This meant that I had one less piece of code to maintain :)</p>
<h2 id="cleaning-up">Cleaning up</h2>
<p>I would like to use the same STM folder for some personal stuff too, so I just cleaned things up my moving my projects and the GitHub links into a <code>work</code> folder</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>STM/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>├── work/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>│   ├── projects -&gt; ~/work/code
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>│   └── gh/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>│       ├── project1.url
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>│       ├── project2.url
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>│       └── project3.url
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>└── zoom/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    ├── standup.url
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    ├── my.url
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    └── name1.url
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And I was done! It just works​!</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a project that will help you to optimize your workflow and allow you to quickly access URLs or folders on your file system, do consider <a href="https://github.com/Hofknecht/SystemTrayMenu">SystemTrayMenu</a>. It is a fantastic tool to add to your arsenal.</p>
<p>Always scratch your itch. It can lead down wonderful paths of exploration and learning. Being Head of Engineering means I don&rsquo;t spend too much time writing code. This experiment of mine allowed me to jump back into my coding roots and figure things out - I had a lot of fun! :) I even ended up automating the process of creating the <code>STM</code> directory into a nice little C# DSL that I ended up calling <em>Quick</em> and looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> QuickBase(
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> QuickFolder(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;work&#34;</span>, 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> QuickFolder(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;gh&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> QuickGithubDump(GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN)),
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> QuickFolderShortcut(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;projects&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">@&#34;D:\work\code&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  ),
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> QuickFolder(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;zoom&#34;</span>, 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> QuickURLShortcut(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;standup&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://zoom.us/j/...&#34;</span>),
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> QuickURLShortcut(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;me&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://zoom.us/j/...&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  )
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>quick.Execute(<span style="color:#e6db74">@&#34;D:\quick&#34;</span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With that, I&rsquo;m signing off. Take care, stay safe, get vaccinated.</p>
