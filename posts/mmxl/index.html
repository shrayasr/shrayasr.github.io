			<p>As i sit here in this room , music in my ear , distraction free editor
in front of me i can feel thousands of people thanking god for a new
year from tomorrow , even thousands more making resolutions and even
more partying .. Yet why do i sit here ?</p>
<p>For me, a new year means nothing . Its just another day . Does it mean
anything ? The earth just spinning around its own axis , and just
revolving around the sun - Night turning into Day , Day turning into
Night .</p>
<p>What i&rsquo;m more concerned is, in this abstract new year what am i going to
do that will make me sit 1 year from now and write something better, and
tell all ya&rsquo;ll that i&rsquo;ve actually done something.</p>
<p>Let me pause .</p>
<p>Let me look back .</p>
<p>What&rsquo;ve i done ?</p>
<p>Gotten a Camera ?</p>
<p>Gotten into SAP ?</p>
<p>Graduated with high scores ?</p>
<p>Got a mac ?</p>
<p>Do you think any of that matters when you sit back and think about what
you actually have done ?</p>
<p>Materialism. Hmf!</p>
<p>I think i&rsquo;mma ready for more .</p>
<p>Yes i have a Canon Rebel XSI, Yes i&rsquo;m in SAP , Yes I got high scores,
Yes i have a mac .</p>
<p>But with all this .. is there something i can do ? Is there something
that i can do differently that will make people notice me ? Is there
something that i can do, to make a difference ?</p>
<p>I want to . And i must.</p>
<p>This is not a resolution that i&rsquo;m going to make cause i dont believe in
planning for the future yet since i dont see a necessity in doing so
right now (sorry dad.)</p>
<p>But this is more of a Resolve.</p>
<p>This is more of a mindset.</p>
<p>This is more of becoming more me.</p>
<p>This is the path that i need to follow . This is the path not formed.
This is the path i&rsquo;m sure that my dad would like me take simple because
there is no path . I need to make one.</p>
<p>And this i dont do for my dad or for any other soul in this world. This
i do for myself. I need this . I need to break free. I need to carve a
name for myself .</p>
<p>Yea i suck .</p>
<p>I know i do .</p>
<p>I know few languages</p>
<p>I know somethings more</p>
<p>I know that i can do a few things better than the rest of the people
around me</p>
<p>But now i want to put those few things to a test.</p>
<p>Can i actually do something with all of things that i can do better ?</p>
<p>I know i can .</p>
<p>I know i will .</p>
<p>If not ACTUALLY do something, i know that i will make an attempt.</p>
<p>Because once you start making a path for yourself .. people will
eventually start helping you . Your family, your friends. Yes they
matter simply because i cant do this on my own . I need people to stand
beside me . I dont want a leader, I dont want to lead . Its a pain.</p>
<p>So i say to you all here . And at 9:10 PM on the 31st December 2010</p>
<p>I SUCK . I WILL BECOME BETTER.</p>
<p>Watch for a post in 1 year .</p>
<p>But thats all for this year .</p>
<p>Before i get leaving ,</p>
<p>I love you dad , mom .</p>
<p>and I love you guys (you all know who you are)</p>
<p>and dad , i always stick to what i said, i&rsquo;m sorry if its harsh but not
many people matter to me in the world.</p>
<p>You all are my world and i&rsquo;m happy with it .</p>
<p>Fuck off 2010 .</p>
<p>You started making the new me . 2011 will add on to that .</p>
