      <title>On Running; The Full Marathon experience</title>

      <description>For context, I&amp;rsquo;ve been running since a good 4 years now.
 4 years of putting 1 foot ahead of another. 4 years of braving through pain. 4 years of surviving injuries. 4 years of meeting wonderful people. 4 years of time to reflect.  After doing 4 years of running, I thought I had it under my belt. I thought that I had &amp;ldquo;figured out&amp;rdquo; running. After having run so many kilometers with so many people across so many cities and clocking so many hours, I was under the impression that I was &amp;ldquo;comfortable&amp;rdquo; with the sport of running.</description>

      <title>Generate a quick AWS dashboard using LINQPad</title>

      <description>Context Logic Soft&amp;rsquo;s mainline product &amp;ndash; WINBDS is an on premise software i.e. we install it at the client location and we support them remotely.
Since a while now,this has been seeing a change. For small installations, usually an instance on the cloud works out cheaper and better. So we&amp;rsquo;ve begun suggesting people to move to AWS when the installation is small enough.
Turns out, if we&amp;rsquo;re diligent about turning the instances off when we don&amp;rsquo;t need them, a windows box on AWS is actually pretty affordable.</description>

      <title>Express solutions elegantly using your programming language</title>
      <link>https://www.shrayas.com/posts/express-solutions-elegantly-using-your-prog-lang/</link>

      <description>Introduction The post features a case study of a real life problem and the C# programming language. It explains how we went about trying to best express the solution within the bounds of the C# language.
Although we use the C# programming language here,the ideas shared in this post aren&amp;rsquo;t specific to it and can be applied to any high level language you are working with.
Problem Recently, for a customer requirement we had to work with a document that has both metadata and data.</description>

      <description>Background Circa 2013 - 2014, I was quite the couch potato. Sure I had played a bit of Basket ball in school and got my everyday quota of India&amp;rsquo;s favourite game - gully cricket, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ever an active person.
That is, until The Himalayas happened.
Soon after my first trek, Raghu and I decided one evening that we&amp;rsquo;d just take a bus to some part of town. Our rendezvous point was about 1 Kilometer from where I stayed at that point.</description>

      <title>Hiccups with Hosting ASP .NET 5 apps on Linux (RC1)</title>
      <link>https://www.shrayas.com/posts/aspnet5-hosting-hiccups-nginx-kestrel/</link>

      <description>Background After the recent dance with multiple Mono versions, the next step was to actually host the application.
Even though the app is largely still unfinished, I wanted to give it a shot on the staging instance to get a feel for things.
The general way to host apps on a Linux box is to have a NGINX reverse proxy in front, listening to different names on port 80 and to proxy the requests to internally running servers.</description>

      <title>ASP .NET 5, Npgsql, Linux &amp; Mono 4.2</title>

      <description>Background Logic Soft&amp;lsquo;s primary application is a Windows based application written in C# using Windows.Forms. So when Microsoft announced ASP .NET 5 RC1, needless to say, we were quite excited.
We picked it up and started our experimentation - writing smaller applications and porting some of our side projects to the CoreCLR platform. As long as we didn&amp;rsquo;t go to the place that needed WIN32 APIs, it worked seamlessly.
With a small sum of experience, we took up the task of writing one of our internal dashboards with it.</description>

      <title>Dynamic prepared statements in Clojure</title>

      <description>So just recently, at Logic Soft, we put our first (small) clojure project into production. It was a small library management system that was custom developed for one of our existing clients.
At Logic Soft, we are majorly a .NET house but we&amp;rsquo;re beginning to experiment with different platforms and technologies and felt that this was a small enough project to give clojure a shot (alongside other experiments we conducted with it).</description>

      <title>A day with Clojure</title>

      <description>It has been a hectic month for me at Logic Soft. I&amp;rsquo;m working on quite a few design related activities for the upcoming book fairs and other internal office work. In doing all of this, most of my programming related activities have been put on hold.
This was ok at first, but then it kind of started getting to me. I really enjoy design but then I find it less satisfying than writing programs.</description>

      <title>On Education</title>

      <description>Education has always eluded me. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I really enjoy learning, unlearning and relearning. I just think that the &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve had, didn&amp;rsquo;t teach me this.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never really been a top achiever. I&amp;rsquo;ve never really been the one whose parents could show him off saying he&amp;rsquo;s achieved top grades in class. I&amp;rsquo;ve never really been the one getting into &amp;ldquo;enrichment&amp;rdquo; classes. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been the one who revises before exams; heck I&amp;rsquo;ve never finished studying my portions before the exams.</description>

      <title>The Himalayas</title>

      <description>In February this year, I visited the holy shrine of Vaishnodevi in Jammu. It is about a 12 KM walk from the base camp - Katra till the holy shrine and I enjoyed that walk more than the darshan itself. The idea of a himalayan trek has been with me for really long but when I looked at the nature surrounding me during that trek, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d go to the Himalayas this year; I decided I&amp;rsquo;d do the trek.</description>

      <description>ðŸ’¡ This post was written long ago and might not necessarily reflect my thoughts at this time Some people see him in deities. Some people see him as a spiritual being. Some people believe he was a human living among us.
Me, I dont believe in religion. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. I believe in a god. I believe in a power but I&amp;rsquo;m not a part of those groups that separate this being into different sects demarked by religion.</description>

      <title>Reality, Perspective and.. God</title>
      <link>https://www.shrayas.com/posts/reality-perspective-and-god/</link>

      <description>ðŸ’¡ This post was written long ago and might not necessarily reflect my thoughts at this time The title indicates something very spiritual, but trust me its not. I&amp;rsquo;m not a very spiritual guy and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will ever be.
These 3 words have meanings associated with them. But today I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and side track you away from what you know of reality, from what you know of perspectives and what you believe in of god and give you my take on them.</description>

      <description>Its been a really long time since I wrote something.. I guess I lacked that push, I guess I was focussing on other things. But today, I got that push.
7:25PM, was just chilling in my room taking some classes on Natural Language Processing when I got a call &amp;ldquo;Macha, I&amp;rsquo;m in Bangalore, come lets shoot&amp;rdquo;
8:05PM, Brigade Road, I met Waseem. Its been a while since we met and shot together.</description>
