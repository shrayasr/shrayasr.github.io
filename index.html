        <p>My name is Shrayas Rajagopal. I was born in the chilly, yet wonderful city of Bangalore. Following that, I spent most of my life in the tambram city of Chennai.</p>
<p>You can find me as shrayasr on most social media - Twitter / Github / LinkedIn / Facebook / Instagram / etc.</p>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I&rsquo;ve loved computers. I used to tinker around with them so much but it was not until I wrote my first &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo; program that realization hit me - The computer was listening to me!. And that was the start of my journey as a programmer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing programs for the larger part of 10 years now. I&rsquo;ve been part of projects at college that were used till about 2 years ago and I&rsquo;ve been part of failing teams at work that didn&rsquo;t see the light of day, but we built some amazing tech.</p>
<p>Currently, I head engineering at Logic Soft in Chennai. We&rsquo;ve been around for 30+ years and we build softwares for the book trade &ndash; Publishing / Distribution and Retail. Although its a niche, its a strong enough market for us to have been in it for so long and still contribute back. As the head of engineering, I do a lot of team building, hiring and spend time thinking about improving the productivity and developer experiences inside the organization.</p>
<p>Previously at SAP Labs in Bangalore, I was responsible for managing my entire team&rsquo;s infrastructure and helped build out the entire middleware layer into a clean and pragmatic RESTful API.</p>
<p>Currently, the language of choice both for personal and professional work is C#. In my years of using it, I&rsquo;ve found the language to be quirky yet pragmatic. The ecosystem around it is very strong and with Microsoft embracing the world of open source and coming out with .Net Core, its only going to get even stronger.</p>
<p>My editor of choice is vim and my love for it is very unconditional. You can find my dotfiles here</p>
<p>The open source community has played quite a large role in my life. The major one being that it helps to keep me rooted to the ground. It helps me realize that I still have a lot to learn. Another thing is that it assures me that a bunch of completely random people from around the world can come together on an idea and just work on it, irrespective of any barriers that humanity has set up for itself. Which is why I always try and take time out to contribute where ever I can.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I enjoy running, trekking, photography, cooking and travelling</p>
