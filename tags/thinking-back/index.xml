      <description>Remember MMXL? I wrote it 2 years ago. If you dont remember , click here.
Anyway here goes,
2 years have passed since i last wrote about who i am / what i do. Has anything really changed? Have things become better? Have things become worse? Whatsup?
I think over the past 2 years i&amp;rsquo;ve learnt more about what the world is about and how people are but more importantly i think i&amp;rsquo;ve learnt more about how i fit into this world and how i am and how people are towards me.</description>

      <description>As i sit here in this room , music in my ear , distraction free editor in front of me i can feel thousands of people thanking god for a new year from tomorrow , even thousands more making resolutions and even more partying .. Yet why do i sit here ?
For me, a new year means nothing . Its just another day . Does it mean anything ? The earth just spinning around its own axis , and just revolving around the sun - Night turning into Day , Day turning into Night .</description>
