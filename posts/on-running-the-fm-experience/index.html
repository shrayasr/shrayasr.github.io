			<p>For context, I&rsquo;ve been running since a good 4 years now.</p>
<ul>
<li>4 years of putting 1 foot ahead of another.</li>
<li>4 years of braving through pain.</li>
<li>4 years of surviving injuries.</li>
<li>4 years of meeting wonderful people.</li>
<li>4 years of time to reflect.</li>
</ul>
<p>After doing 4 years of running, I thought I had it under my belt. I thought
that I had &ldquo;figured out&rdquo; running. After having run so many kilometers with so
many people across so many cities and clocking so many hours, I was under the
impression that I was &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; with the sport of running.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong.</p>
<p>In my 4 years of running, I had never done a distance that was more than 25
kilometers in one stretch. I have run 50+ kilometers across a week, but nothing
more than 25K in one run.</p>
<p>Over the past weekend, I attempted to run a full marathon. A full marathon (or
simply, a marathon) is a 42.2 kilometer run. Legend has it that a messenger was
sent from the city of Marathon to Athens &ndash; A distance of 42.2 KMs to announce
the defeat of the Persians.</p>
<p>I had to do this as a qualifier for the <a href="https://malnadultra.com">Malnad Ultra</a>
where I will be running my first ultra marathon of 50 kilometers. And in
preparation for this ultra, I have been running with Chennai&rsquo;s running group -
CTC, over the past 6 months. They&rsquo;re a wonderful, crazy, kind, hilarious bunch
of runners who all seem to have a baseline reason for why they run &ndash;
<em>&ldquo;Bliss&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>So yesterday, via CTC, a bunch of 52 runners ran from Navallur to Mahabalipuram</p>
<ul>
<li>Self supported for a total sum of 42+ kilometers.</li>
</ul>
<p>A bunch of things happened yesterday:</p>
<ul>
<li>I finished my first full marathon</li>
<li>I struggled to finish my first full marathon</li>
<li>I am unable to come to terms with what I experienced</li>
</ul>
<p>The first real <strong>break</strong> during the run is for breakfast, at Ammapet. This is
around the 23K mark. Till here, everything was blissful. I was thoroughly
enjoying the run along with some great company. But post breakfast, things
started to go south.</p>
<h2 id="23k">23K</h2>
<p>We reached Ammapet by around 8:30 and headed out by 9:45 after finishing off
a decent breakfast. And by this time, the sun had already begun shining down
bright and harsh. This is where it truly all begun. All the energy that I had
in the past 23K that I had done, just seemed to melt away. I started to hit
multiple low points in the first few kilometers itself. My mind wasn&rsquo;t just in
the right place at all, and I just couldn&rsquo;t seem to put a pin on it. I tried
drinking lots of water &ndash; to no avail. I tried stretching &ndash; nope. I tried
talking &ndash; that too didn&rsquo;t work. I just seemed to have no way out of it.</p>
<h2 id="30k">30K</h2>
<p>Around this time, a wonderful gentleman who we were running with &ndash; Praveen
came up with the 100 steps walk, 100 steps run arrangement where he would count
100 steps for us to walk and run. This helped. A regime without <strong>my</strong>
intervention really helped me to get into a rhythm. And he did this for nearly
4-5 kilometers for which, I&rsquo;d eternally be grateful to him for. I understand
how difficult it must have been to keep shouting numbers out to let us know
how much we&rsquo;ve done all while he was running with us.</p>
<p>Temperatures still continued to rise</p>
<h2 id="32k">32K</h2>
<p>After a while of doing the run-walk, my mind shut off and I kept to it with no
questions. However around the 32K mark, my right groin started to pull and I
couldn&rsquo;t follow his commands. It was around this time, that I decided to walk
the rest of it.</p>
<p>Temperatures stayed high at a good 35 degrees.</p>
<p>I thought to myself: <em>&ldquo;Just 10 more kilometers. How hard can it be? You run
this everyday&rdquo;</em>. And once again, I couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong.</p>
<h2 id="33k">33K</h2>
<p>Around here, we found a nice pump that was bestowing us with clean and cold
water. After a rudimentary filling of our hydration packs, we proceeded to
wet our caps, buffs and the t shirts too. But as irony would like it, all of
them dried out within the next 5 minutes &ndash; short lived effect.</p>
<p>The walking continued. Slowly, but surely.</p>
<p>I started the entire race averaging an average of ~8 per kilometer but post
Ammapet, I had dropped to 10+ per kilometer.</p>
<h2 id="34k---42k">34K - 42K</h2>
<p>Walking.
Walking.
And more walking.</p>
<p>8 kilometers doesn&rsquo;t seem like much, and truthfully, it isn&rsquo;t. I know exactly
how far it is from where I live and it really isn&rsquo;t that much of a distance
at all.</p>
<p>But 8 kilometers with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The temperature being close to 40 degrees</li>
<li>Your body temperature going up</li>
<li>The fatigue beginning to show</li>
<li>The groin pull getting worse and now in both legs,</li>
</ul>
<p>Really amounts to a <strong>huge</strong> ordeal, as I came to learn. These 8 kilometers
would go down in my life as the hardest 8 kilometers that I&rsquo;ve had to put
one foot in front of another for.</p>
<p>Everything just shut off one after another &ndash; I stopped communicating like I
do, I stopped thinking, I stopped listening. I was a walking zombie, trying to
grasp every opportunity to sit down under some shade and just wait for some
passerby to ask them for a lift.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exaggerating when I say that the time I spent moving for these 8
kilometers has been the lowest time of my running career. I started to question
everything that I had learnt from running</p>
<ul>
<li>Did I really put 1 foot ahead of another? Why am I unable to, now?</li>
<li>Did I really brave through pain? Why does this pain so much?</li>
<li>Did I really survive injuries? Am I in for another bout of injuries?</li>
<li>Did I really meet wonderful people? Why am I not engaging with them?</li>
<li>Did I really reflect? Then why didn&rsquo;t I realize this before?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="post-42k">Post 42K</h2>
<p>After 2 days of deep thinking, I&rsquo;ve realized what went wrong. It wasn&rsquo;t the
heat or the pain. It was my over confidence. I kept telling people who were
close to me that something inside me broke on this journey. I finally was able
to understand what it was. It was the sense of confidence I had placed in
myself that I <strong>understood</strong> what it was to run such distances.</p>
<p>One thing was evident at the end of it all - I truly didn&rsquo;t understand or
realize what it meant to run <strong>42</strong> kilometers, totally self supported, with or
without friends, in insane heat. I didn&rsquo;t understand how my body functioned
beyond the previous longest distance of 25K. I didn&rsquo;t understand how my mind
functioned when my body started giving up. I didn&rsquo;t understand anything that
I thought I did.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;enlightening&rdquo; turn around point. No. I didn&rsquo;t start running
miraculously after this realization. In fact I happened upon this realization
only after 30 hours of thinking about what went wrong.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, this past Saturday, I failed myself. I <strong>finished</strong> the
FM but I failed myself. And its not something I&rsquo;m sad about, at all. I just
wanted to understand what it is that went wrong. And this was what it was.</p>
<p>So folks, from this experience, I&rsquo;m inclined to request of you <strong>never</strong> to
under estimate distance, heat, time, hydration and comfort when you&rsquo;re running.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you&rsquo;re starting off, 1K seems like a daunting deal</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;ve run for a while, 10K seems like a daunting deal</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;ve run for 4 years, 42K didn&rsquo;t seem like a daunting deal</li>
</ul>
<p>This has been one of the greatest reality checks I&rsquo;ve got in a while and I&rsquo;m
happy that I put myself though this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this much, and you&rsquo;ve experienced this yourself, I&rsquo;d love to
hear your point of view on the whole thing. Thank you for spending your time on
this ranty, self-reflectory blog. I truly appreciate it.</p>
<p>Till next time, Happy running.</p>
