			<p>Right now, i sit in one of the most corrupt offices in the city . Which
city? every single one of them in India .</p>
<p>Let me tell you 1 simple fact about how stupid i am . I lost my wallet ,
A couple of months ago . With it went woooosh my:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pan Card</li>
<li>License</li>
<li>Landmark fellowship card .. You may ask why this is so important ?
well because the card&rsquo;s number was 000001 :)</li>
<li>2k</li>
<li>memories</li>
</ol>
<p>Now , i need a license , i wish to drive a car , a swift or an i10 , but
that isn&rsquo;t important . The base point - I need a license .</p>
<p>Dad made a couple of calls .</p>
<p>the R T O , the Regional Transport Office.</p>
<p>People around me , all waiting , all sitting on the slab that i am
sitting on . Like one of my friends
<a href="http://trulyrd.wordpress.com/2011/05/03/distinction/">quoted</a> , there
is no distinction between us people sitting on the slab . The real
distinction is not physical . The real distinction is more of how we
came to sit on this same slab .</p>
<p>I came, and i will accept, through what they call a &lsquo;broker&rsquo;. Which is
just a glorified way of calling a peon . A person who can get things
done .</p>
<p>Do i feel guilty ? Yes , as hell . Why ? Because i&rsquo;m just another pawn
in this corrupt society, feeding the demon that is corruption . A big ,
black thing with no physical form , much like goop or a swampy creature
with big red eyes of temptation is how i picture this Corruption .</p>
<p>Its not a concept anymore . Its something . A &lsquo;thing&rsquo; that has an
identity . A thing that we feed . A thing that we breed .</p>
<p><em>update:</em><br>
I just went into an office . This is the office of the P.A to the RTO,
(RTO meaning the Regional Transport Officer) and lied to him . Told him
that i can possibly only get 1 day(s) of leave from my office and asked
him if he could sign the re-issue papers . He looked at me , he looked
at the &lsquo;broker&rsquo; and slyly said that he couldn&rsquo;t do it and that we had to
wait for the RTO as such . He continued on and told me to go , and sent
the broker soon after . I wonder .</p>
<p>While all of us are stuck waiting in never ending lines , these people -
the &lsquo;brokers&rsquo; dont have such a line , they have &ldquo;another&rdquo; line . I
wonder .</p>
<p>There are a lot of things i wonder about , and one such thing ISN&rsquo;T
corruption . Because there really isn&rsquo;t anything to wonder about, is
there?:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You pay , they give . You pay more , they give sooner . You pay even
more , you dont even need it . <em>C&rsquo;est la vie .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering the way things are moving here, there is one little proverb
that i have always admired that needs an addition .</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blood is thicker than water ?<br>
Money is thicker than blood . </p>
</blockquote>
<p>*Update: *<br>
OK , things are done now . Heres what happened:</p>
<p>After i met the PA , i waited for some more time and then went and met
the RTO dude himself, directly . Lied to him that i had only 1 day(s)
leave and then he lectured me about how <strong>HE</strong> had to wait 10 days in
line to get admission into a school for his son . But hell! I guess he
had been successful in that adventure . He signed the papers and the
major hurdle was crossed . The rest was supposed to be , as our
thalaivar, Mr. Rajini Sir would say: &ldquo;jujubi&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following that, I came out and waited in line to get my picture taken .
Then started the ordeal . I sat to be photographed 3 times and kept
getting sent back because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was a duplication request and not a fresh license or a renewal and hence i had to get some more signatures</li>
<li>There was no bill attached for the amount paid , i had to come over and get the bill</li>
<li>The name on the bill was Mukesh and lets face it , i am neither the great singer or a &ldquo;really really&rdquo; fat dude. </li>
</ul>
<p>So with all these things taken care of , i approached the chair like it
was a throne that i had to earn my place on and asked the dude before
sitting . &ldquo;Anna, should i sit or do i need to run around some more?&rdquo; .
He laughed and said &ldquo;Thambi , no payan (pain) no gayan (gain)&rdquo; . That
gave me the laugh i needed for the picture .</p>
<p>Ok, yes i&rsquo;m English-ist . Its a beautiful language and needs to be
resspected .</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the topic. So after all these miniscule things , i came
out of the Picture room (as they all call it) triumphant . My DL will be
delivered at most by tomorrow .</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P = 1 .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So i guess what i&rsquo;m trying to say is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you know the PM? I know someone better .</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you stand in line from 5 in the morning ? I know someone better .</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you skip lunch and breakfast because you need to get your passport renewed ? I know someone better . </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the same case with all of us . Poor souls who dont know the
&lsquo;someone better&rsquo; will suffer because we KNOW the &lsquo;someone better&rsquo; or
better put , because we can AFFORD the &lsquo;someone better&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>People will believe that change in this kind of a place is not possible
. They will go forth to believe that this is our life .</p>
<p>These kinds of things are FOOD to that goopy swampy creature. I know
that a creature that is so big cannot be easily conqured . But lets take
small steps , tiny ones .</p>
<p>Let start by poking it , then lets take the bigger weapons . Burn it and
hopefully slay it .</p>
<p>Its not something that we can do within a day . Not something that can
be done in a year or even in 10 years .</p>
<p>But lets at least start doing something about it so that maybe , just
maybe our grand grand grand grand kids can live a life where truly &ldquo;No
pain, No gain&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>You may ask me 1 simple question , why all talk when you are giving food
to that creature ?</p>
<p>I tell you from the bottom of my heart today , i will give my share of
pokes to this creature . I shall try to not give these peons money and
get my things done .</p>
<p>Because there is nothing in this world that matches hardwork .</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I might have won this war . But things will come back .</p>
<p>What goes around , comes around .<br>
What has a beginning , must end .<br>
what is a corrupt country , can cease to be one .</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back home , and i&rsquo;m hungry as fuck . I need my food .</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;maaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Signing off .</p>
