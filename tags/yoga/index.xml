      <description>When I started with my training plan, yoga wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly my strong point. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t flow, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even sustain a pose, I never felt like I was doing anything at all. I never felt like I &amp;ldquo;worked out&amp;rdquo;. My coach asked to believe in the practice and to give it my best. And, I continued to try. It&amp;rsquo;s been about a year now that I started this journey and things have changed so much.</description>
