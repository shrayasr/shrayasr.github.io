      <description>Background After the recent dance with multiple Mono versions, the next step was to actually host the application.
Even though the app is largely still unfinished, I wanted to give it a shot on the staging instance to get a feel for things.
The general way to host apps on a Linux box is to have a NGINX reverse proxy in front, listening to different names on port 80 and to proxy the requests to internally running servers.</description>
