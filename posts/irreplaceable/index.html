			<p>I&rsquo;ve always had a secret dream. Something that iHavent shared with
anyone. Something not even the closest of friends know. Thats because
iThought there was still more time. But it so turns out that sometimes
even though you think you have time , it is stolen right royally from
your hands.</p>
<p>This secret dream that iHave i&rsquo;m going to share today.</p>
<p>This dream is one that iHave had ever since iWas a kid.</p>
<p>But now, its one of those dreams that iAm forced to leave behind.</p>
<p>Why ?</p>
<p>Simply because 6 weeks isn&rsquo;t enough time for me to meet Steve Jobs.</p>
<hr>
<p>There have always been people that iHave looked up to, simply because
iBelieve in the fact that no matter how good you are , there is always
ONE person who is better than you are .</p>
<p>He has always held a place in my heart.</p>
<p>iWanted to meet him, and tell him how he&rsquo;s influenced me to make my
presentations better ..<br>
iWanted to meet him, and tell him how i&rsquo;ve learnt part of how to speak
merely by listening to his talks ..<br>
iWanted to meet him, and tell him, that iConsider him a true genius of
the world.</p>
<p>But iCant. Why?</p>
<p>Simply because 6 weeks isn&rsquo;t enough time for me to meet Steve Jobs.</p>
<hr>
<p>He is one person who has changed the world .<br>
He is one person who almost made me drop out of college (yea dad, sorry.
iWanted to.)<br>
He is one person who redefined presentations<br>
He is one person who mastered the art of talking.<br>
He is one person who will create a void in the world.</p>
<p>and definitely in me.</p>
<p>What would you do if you knew that your bio clock would stop ticking in
6 weeks .</p>
<p>Would you look at it like 1/8th of a year<br>
Would you look at it like a month and 2 weeks ?<br>
or would you look at it like 42 days ?</p>
<p>Why would it matter how you look at it ? You aren&rsquo;t going to get any
more time . You aren&rsquo;t going to change anything .</p>
<p>Why look at the 6 weeks that you have left rather than looking back at
the n years that you have lived.</p>
<p>Because as he himself said .. you NEED to look back in order to connect
the dots.</p>
<p>One thing that we all really need to understand is that you&rsquo;re really
really REALLY insignificant.</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>what you do whilst being insignificant, matters . It did to Him .</p>
<p>He has a messianic complex, and its contagious. he believed that he has
to do something to the world.</p>
<p>6 weeks later we&rsquo;ll be able to see that .</p>
<p>iToo , have a messianic complex . iWant to make a difference. iNeed to
be noticed . iWill do it.</p>
<p>iWanted to tell this to Him.</p>
<p>But iCant. Why ?</p>
<p>Simply because 6 weeks isn&rsquo;t enough time for me to meet Steve Jobs.</p>
<hr>
<p>iAm pissed.<br>
iAm irritated.<br>
iAm not in the right state<br>
iDidnt want this time to come so soon<br>
iDont want him to give up.<br>
iStill think he has a lot of people to change.<br>
iThink &ldquo;stevenotes&rdquo; should be incorporated in the dictionary<br>
iWant to cry.</p>
<p>Why ?</p>
<p>Simply because 6 weeks isn&rsquo;t enough time for me to meet Steve Jobs.</p>
<hr>
<p>iGot this news a couple of days back and it truly did bring tears to my
eyes.<br>
iDo hope this is a rumour.<br>
iDo hope that he releases an iPhone 10.</p>
<p>Because iWant to tell him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Steve,<br>
There are a lot more things in this world that require an &ldquo;i&rdquo; beside
their name.<br>
There are a lot more things in this world that are worth a
&ldquo;stevenote&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is always &ldquo;one more thing&rdquo; that deserves you.</p>
<p>But heres me being selfish,<br>
iHope you read this and know:<br>
iHave always wanted to meet you.<br>
iWant to meet you&hellip;</p>
<p>Please dont ruin a kid&rsquo;s dream.<br>
Please dont give me just 6 weeks to meet you.<br>
Please dont give up.</p>
<p>~<br>
Shrayas.</p>
